        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
        <p>Fried Bake is a popular Trinidadian bread that's soft on the inside and golden on the outside. Made with flour, baking powder, and water, it's deep-fried until it puffs up, creating a light, airy texture. Often eaten for breakfast, it pairs perfectly with saltfish, eggs, or even cheese.</p>
