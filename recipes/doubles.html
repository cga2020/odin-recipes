        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Doubles is a popular street food originating from Trinidad and Tobago. It consists of two pieces of fried flatbread called bara, filled with curried chickpeas known as channa. Often topped with various chutneys, pepper sauce, and sometimes cucumber or tamarind sauce, Doubles is known for its spicy, savory flavor and soft, satisfying texture. It's typically eaten for breakfast or as a quick snack and has become a beloved staple in Trinidadian cuisine. </p>
